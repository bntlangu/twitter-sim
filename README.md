**Twitter-Sim**

This repository is the home of Twitter-Sim - a lightweight tool for simulating the behaviour of twitter for the purpose of demonstrating software engineering ability.

*Please note that any activity enacted on this simulator will not affect reall Twitter accounts.*

## Register user(s)

Start by running the user registration simulation "register_users.exe". Using the input file "data/register.txt" this utility will run through the file line by line and attempt to register the users listed in the input file with the twitter-sim application.

1. In a command **Terminal**, where golang is installed, type:
**go build register_users -o register_users.exe**
2. Run the application executable with the input file specified as an argument:
**register_users ./data/register.txt**

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
